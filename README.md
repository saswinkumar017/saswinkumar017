👋 Hello! I'm Aswin Kumar
I'm a Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student, just getting started with my programming journey. I use this GitHub profile mainly to practice coding, upload my lab work, and slowly build up my skills and confidence in the tech field.

🧑‍💻 What I'm Currently Doing:
Practicing C programming through college lab exercises

Exploring how Git and GitHub work for version control

Learning the basics of problem-solving and how to write clean code

Starting to look into web development and other useful tech skills

📁 My Repositories:(Public)

Program_C – Extra C programs for practice and learning

Model_Portfolio – Planning to build a simple portfolio site here in future

Aswinkumar – Just my profile readme and setup files

🎯 My Short-Term Goals:
Understand programming concepts more deeply

Improve my logic-building and debugging skills

Build small projects on my own

Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript step by step

Start contributing to beginner-friendly open source projects
