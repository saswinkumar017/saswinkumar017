👋 Hello! I'm Aswin Kumar
I'm a Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student, just getting started with my programming journey. I use this GitHub profile mainly to practice coding, upload my lab work, and slowly build up my skills and confidence in the tech field.


🎯 My Short-Term Goals:
Understand programming concepts more deeply

Improve my logic-building and debugging skills

Build small projects on my own
